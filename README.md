# Documentations

Check out [Plugin Documentation](https://github.com/nfnfgo/obsidian-aliasor/wiki) wiki page for more info.

# Recommended Workflow

It's **highly recommended to add a hotkey for "Aliasor:Execute command by alias"**, for example you could add `Control + Shift + P` as the hotkey.

Then if you need to execute a command by its alias, you just need to:

1. Press the hotkey you set
2. Enter the alias
3. Execute that command!
