# Contributing to the Translation

Currently, the Korean and Japanese languages are auto-translated using AI. If you find any issues with the translations or if you want to improve them, you can help by providing better translations.

If you want to contribute to the translation, you can find the translation files in the `src/locales` directory. Each language has its own JSON file. You can add or modify translations in these files and then create a pull request.
